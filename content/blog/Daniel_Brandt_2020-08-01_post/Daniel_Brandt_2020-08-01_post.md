We're all pandemic experts at this point, right? Well, if it's a viral
pandemic, then we\'ve all learned a lot. Unfortunately, some pandemics
have gone mostly unattended, and are killing our society. One that has
impacted my life personally and the lives of *every* man I've ever met
is pornography. I did not misspeak in saying this affects every single
man I've ever met. *Ever.* That might be shocking to some readers, but I
can't be more clear about this. Every man has some sort of battle with
this, whether it's something they are currently involved in, they are
trying to recover from addiction, or it was just in their past. But even
those who are not currently indulging, it is always a temptation that
could lure them in at any moment. Although the issue is so widespread,
that does not mean it should be normalized and accepted, just a reality
to be well aware of. But a big part of the issue is the way that society
and media *have* normalized it. I have talked with many men about this
issue in their lives, and I know a lot that have fought tooth and nail
to rid the disease from their own lives. And as a disclaimer I should
say I am far more qualified in speaking to men who are facing this issue
more than women who are. I imagine a lot of what I write here will reach
women who are struggling just as much, but I can't say that I have the
experience or knowledge to speak to them directly. Nonetheless, this
article is just as much for women as it is for men. I truly believe it
is for everyone, I am passionate that everyone needs to hear at least
part of this discussion. We all need to see this disease for what it
really is.

About three years ago, I was spending time with my friend Josiah walking
around Golden, Colorado just chatting about life. We got on the topic of
pornography and how it has affected each of us. We had both had at least
given some consideration to how it was affecting us and seeing it as an
issue in our lives. We both had some sense that what we were doing was
wrong, and there was certainly shame tied up in it. I know that at that
point in my life I had already put a few years of effort to separate
myself from the lustful habit, without much success. But at this time in
our lives, it was something on both of our hearts.

Talk with any guy who is willing to share and they will tell a similar
story. It's simply a story of accessibility, and we all know and see
that accessibility is only on the rise. Back when I discovered porn,
smartphones and tablets didn't exist. I was doing my google searches on
the family computer. Regardless, the internet is a world of infinite
possibilities. So for a young boy who is flushed with confusing
hormones, it doesn't take long for them to fall into all that is out
there on the internet. And every guy does it one way or another. As I
said, the spread of this pandemic hits every young male I have ever met,
and you will ever meet. It's just a matter of when.

As Josiah and I continued to talk, I grew more and more frustrated. Why
was his story so similar to mine? Not to mention the countless other
times I had already heard it from others. Who had this figured out? Were
there any survivors? I had been fighting this already for about 8 years
of my life with little to show for it. Then I was suddenly struck with a
devastating thought.

**Josiah**: "Sounds like there isn't one."

He was right. We both sat that for a while and took it in. We thought
about the future and the implications of this.

>
> **Daniel**: "Even worse, could you imagine being a married man, with

It hit us both at the same time. The thought was almost unbearable: with
the way both of our lives looked now, that is *exactly* where we were
headed. We were well on our way to having a marriage and children and
bringing an addiction to pornography and masturbation right along with
us. We thought about a man with a family who was addicted to porn, and
I'll tell you that both of us *hated* that man. The thought of such a
man utterly disgusted us. There are two sides to this that make it such
a terrifying thought. One is that you have to tell your wife about your
addiction. She might already know, and she might have put up with it one
way or another, but I believe that weighs on any woman. If she has no
idea, then revealing it might be heartbreaking. If she already knows,
then she has probably been putting up with it for a while and still has
to even though you have vowed to commit to her. The second side is that
it eventually will weigh on your family somehow. I'll get into this more
later, but watching porn warps your sexual desires and performance, and
this will surely play into your sex life. Also, no father wants their
kid to get addicted to porn, especially at a young age (as many are
today). How do you face your child when you are addicted to it yourself?
And the thought of this reality is what woke us up. We were terrified of
becoming this image, and so we were shot awake and into action.

And this is the question every man needs to ask themselves, and I
believe they do ask themselves in some way. But it really depends on the
question: is this an issue? And the answer is very important. Widely,
there are two responses that I believe divide men. One response is: No,
everyone does it and it's a healthy way for me to release the sexual
tension I deal with every day. The result of this first response is that
you go on masturbating daily, as you please, and you watch porn almost
every time. And as I've seen in my own life and many others, you usually
want to get more and more exotic with your experience and so you try out
different things and watch new and exciting stuff to see what else is
out there. A rabbit trail that is certainly endless, and most of all
destructive. The other response is: Yes, what I'm doing is wrong, and I
want to stop. But how one moves forward with this response is quite
varied, and we will get into that more.

Let's address this question, "is pornography and masturbation an
issue?", more thoroughly so I can try to convince you through what I
have seen in many people's lives. The truth is, I have heard all sorts
of viewpoints from many people. Some have accepted porn as part of their
life and some have no doubt that porn is an issue. The views on
masturbation vary even wider. *Side note: I am not going to stray away
from addressing masturbation in this article. I know that it is a bit
more taboo, but it is an issue all in itself and you will see that here
as I share more stories. I promise not to get graphic, but I will not
let it sit in the shadows or assume anything.*

It wasn't long ago that pornography was widely accepted as harmful.

And the normalization has caused mass confusion. The more that it has
become available, the more it has been consumed, and the more it has
been accepted by our culture as a result. Watching porn, especially as a
man, just seems *normal* these days. But in a lot of cases, if you
decide that it is normal, you are ignoring how abnormal what you are
doing is. What's truly ironic about the normalization is that although
people are fine to joke about it and reference it in popular media, they
don't really talk about it on a personal level. It's rare for someone to
talk about their own porn usage, and for them to reflect on it
themselves. I find that someone doesn't give much thought about porn's
impact on their life until they've opened up to someone about it.
Honestly, a lot of it doesn't sound all that crazy until you say it out
loud. But people don't. They just hide in it (and that is a big reason
why I am writing this article, why it needs to be written). Fortunately,
there are a large number of people that have recognized the corruption
of porn. In recent years there have been tons of research and case
studies that have shown the negative effects of porn on our mental,
physical and emotional health. There is even the reality that watching
porn is contributing to sex slavery. There are quite a few solid TED
talks out there that address why porn is harmful (I'll link a couple at
the end). Search this information out, I encourage you to because I
won't spend a lot of time here going into the data or that side of
things. But I will say this: anyone who has been addicted to porn and
has had an active sex life cannot deny that porn has an influence. And
It's hard to erase some of the images that imprint in your brain. Anyone
could attest to this (trust me, I know many that have).

I was only just talking about pornography though. Look at the science
and evidence, do some self-reflection, most will agree at the end of the
day porn is harmful and dangerous. But why do most men watch porn? What
does it lead to? Usually, it is only a means to an end, and that end is
masturbation. Masturbation is the satisfaction of the sexual
desire/drive that is at the head of the ship. And unfortunately, this is
where many more diverge in thought.

> **Josiah:** "It's too obvious to me how porn has warped my sexual
> desires and the way I view women. It seems obvious that it must be cut

> justify that".

Many who choose the second response, "Yes this is an issue", will either
try to cut out both porn and masturbation altogether, or tackle one at a
time, and the one they tackle is usually porn. Cut out porn from their
lives, then deal with masturbation. And in some cases, men will decide
that masturbation isn't an issue at all. It's clear to them that all the
issues I described above (and more) with porn are something they want to
avoid, but what is the harm in masturbation? Isn't it just a natural
release? If I don't currently have a healthy sex life, how else am I
supposed to relieve this tension? There are countless other ways people
explain and justify it.

I have talked to many men my age about this issue in their lives. And as
a result, I have seen many perspectives. One more recent story goes like
this. A friend of mine has recently been introspective about how porn
and masturbation have affected him. For many years, it had been a habit
that he didn't give much thought to. But after talking with some friends
concerning it, he realized it might be worth analyzing. After some
personal research, he found that pornography had many negative effects
on his health and society, so it was easy for him to turn away from that
(in theory more so than practice). But like others, he wasn't sure why
he would stop masturbating. After some external motivation, he decided
that he would just try and quit masturbating to see if there was any
difference in his life. But he did not expect what he found out. What
happened after about 2 days of abstaining? He masturbated. He got back
on the horse, disappointed. Only about 1 day this time before he caved
and masturbated again. Maybe it's just a habit to break. Well, this
cycle went on for nearly 3 to 4 months. Sometimes doing as well to make
it a week of abstaining, but rarely and never more. Why? What was going
on? My friend came to realize he was addicted to masturbating, addicted
to the high of the experience. This realization was a wake-up call for
him. He set out to stop the "habit" but found that it was so much
farther out of his control than he realized. And this isn't simply an
anecdote. This is the record of what it is always like. Sure I've heard
of some going a month cold turkey for a bet, but it doesn't last. This
is the experience of anyone who sets out to find freedom. But
unfortunately, most guys don't try to quit and therefore they never find
out. They don't see that it's no easy work: it's a long, hard battle.

Let me also just say this concerning masturbation, when you masturbate
without porn it doesn't make the masturbation innocent. Just ask
yourself: where is your mind at when you masturbate without porn? Or
just ask a friend. It's typically one of two places: objectifying women
or men from your imagination (maybe from an experience) or reanimating
past porn in your head. What's safe about that? Ask yourself, who are
you thinking about when you masturbate? Does that person want to be used
for your sexual pleasure? Is it a friend? How could that affect your
friendship? Or if it's a partner, you are just imagining them for your
own pleasure, it's selfish, and you are only taking from them. Maybe you
are thinking of a porn star or a video you watched, and you might say,
"well they have given me permission by publishing their work". But the
issue with that is continuing to do this will just lead you back into
watching porn consistently. Reconsider what I said earlier: you have far
less control than you think until you acknowledge it. Some will try and
say, "well I'll just do it once a month", but no man I've ever known has
successfully done that. It isn't long until you have returned to your
vomit to consume it.

All this is a serious call to action for the men out there, young and
old, that are stuck in the middle of this battle. And also to any women
who are also addicted and can relate to all this, I know you are out
there. Please hear me out, this is far more serious than you might
think. And it's just as serious now as it will be in the future, as it
will ever be. Therefore, you must take it seriously now. Trust me, if
you are waiting until you are married or in a relationship to take this
seriously I promise it will be too late. If you learn how to figure it
out now, then your future will be taken care of. And by my experience,
that is the only way. If you plan on being married one day and having a
family of your own, you owe it to them. Do what I did 3 years ago and
imagine yourself a few years into marriage, the first kid on the way,
and you still are addicted to watching porn and masturbating. That is
not where you want to be. It's not where I want to be. Think about the
man/woman you want to be for them, and realize what you need to do now.

This is also a serious call to women to understand the reality that men
face and what we are going through daily. This might be the bigger hope
I had in writing this article. One of the grand downsides to men not
talking about this enough is that it can be hard for women to understand
our struggle, or even that it is a struggle. They just don't get the
opportunity to hear what it's like for us, until maybe they are too
close and it's too painful. I must reiterate that every man deals with
this, so every man you meet, and date, will have some past experience
and present battle with this. If you're looking for a man that has
steered clear his whole life, I'm sorry, he doesn't exist. That should
not be hopeless, because there is a stark difference between a man who
has accepted it as part of his life and a man who is fighting for
change. Again, there is a huge difference between a proactive man and a
complacent one. Please, have grace on us for the war we face every day.
I am not asking that you just put up with this disgusting disease, but
that you have grace on who we are for who we may become. Believe in us,
and encourage us in this battle. We need it from the women in our lives
most. A man who is vulnerable about his struggle and is only met with
abandonment is a man who will dig himself into a deeper hole and never
want to share his heart again.

But this is not the end. This is only the first part of this
conversation. The next part is seeking the light at the end of the
tunnel. In my next article, I will talk about the hope we have in this
situation and the freedom that can be experienced. I will also talk more
about how the women in our lives can encourage us and fight for us.
There is so much good to come out of this conversation, and so more on
that next time.

*For all readers: I must reiterate that I have written this article to
reach everybody. I am passionate that everyone needs to hear at least
part of this discussion, men and women alike. But I do recognize that
people have varied opinions on this, and will receive it differently.
I'm okay with that. I am a young male, who grew up as a Christian, and
so that is where I am coming from. But, I definitely am not writing this
for only Christian men, and I do not try to take any sort of Christian
approach in this article. But that is where I am coming from. I hope to
reach all men and women, both of a religious and nonreligious
background. As I said, I have far more experience discussing this with
men. And I know women have widely varied views on the subject from
personal experience. But I hope you will at least consider the call I am
making.*
